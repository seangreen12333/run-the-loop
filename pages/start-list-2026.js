  Men's Elite Race Preview
</h2>

<p>
  With prizes on offer at the 1 km mark as well as the finish, this year’s men’s elite race is going to be a fascinating tactical battle. 
  Early leaders may be chasing the RunDNA 1km prize which will force the contenders to make a decision: 
  go with the surge and risk paying for it late or sit back and trust their finish over the final few hundred metres.
  So who are our top contenders:

  <br />
  So who are our top contenders:
</p>

<p>
  Headlining the men’s elite field is Matt Clarke. The four-time national champion
  and two-time Olympic steeplechaser has called the Uni Loop his home since 2020.
  The Western Athletic athlete will be the man to beat as he looks retain the title
  for Team Tempo and to find out just how fast he can Run The Loop.
</p>

<p>
  Adrian Potter returns after a runner-up finish in 6:01 last year. With the defending
  record holder absent, the Adelaide Harriers athlete will be eyeing the 5:59 course
  record, though alone in this race, the gravel of the Uni Loop is not his home turf
  and presents a different challenge to his usual home of the southern parklands.
</p>

<p>
  Third in 2025, Cooper Giles will look to improve his 6:04 PB. Whether he’s better
  known for his love of Dairy Farmers chocolate milk or his devastating kick is up
  for debate; but one thing’s certain, if the Adelaide Uni athlete is still there with
  200 m to go, the rest of the field may start to worry.
</p>

<p>
  Expect Arron Nitschke to make it an honest race from the front. The Australian
  duathlete brings a huge aerobic engine, and while this is his first official Loop
  race, he knows the course well and we will wait for the moment he decides to roll
  the dice.
</p>

<p>
  U18 standouts Josh Kavanagh and Tristan Kidd will go head-to-head for junior honours.
  The only two U18s in this race, they were separated by just three seconds last year
  and will toe the line knowing exactly what’s required after the rest of the U18
  field has already raced earlier in the evening.
</p>

<p>
  Rounding out our elite field are James McManus, Harry McGregor, Casey Atkinson,
  Joe Cross, Harrison Wade, Zac Connell, and Bailey Giles, all capable of upsetting the favourites
  and claiming the Uni Loop crown.
</p>

{/* WOMEN'S ELITE RACE */}
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12">
  Women's Elite Race Preview
</h2>

<p>
  This year's edition of the Run The Loop will feature a strong elite ladies' field,
  with an abundance of national-class junior middle-distance stars.
</p>

<p>
  Record: Caitlin Adams – 6:47 (2025)
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
  Amelia Sheridan
</h3>

<p>
  In 2026, 14-year-old Millie doesn’t need a big introduction. A multiple national gold
  medalist over the 1500/3000m and cross-country events, last year she ran a blistering
  time (6:52) and was just 5 seconds behind senior national representative Caitlin Adams.
  Millie continues to improve this year, producing a gun-to-tape national 1500m all
  schools victory, with a huge PB of 4.22. Not only will she be looking to go one better
  this year, but it would be no surprise if she covers the gravel loop in under the
  course record on Friday night!
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
  Tilly Williams
</h3>

<p>
  A part of the reason the record will be under threat this year is because of another
  junior talent, in Tilly Williams. There is zero doubt that Tilly will challenge for
  the win, with her tenacious attacking running style! Another 14-year-old, Tilly, was
  2nd to Millie in the national all schools 1500 (4.28). With great speed, endurance, and
  running form, Tilly is always one to watch in any event from 800 to 5000m. There’s no
  doubt that the quality Adelaide Harrier will enjoy the 2.2km distance!
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
  Hannah Tourneur
</h3>

<p>
  Last year’s 3rd place getter (7:07) and talented middle distance runner, Hannah, will
  be out to improve on that result. Dual silver medallist in the 1500/3000m at the recent
  U18 all schools in December, she has stepped up her training in the past 2 months and
  will be a shot at the prestigious 7-minute barrier. However, with racing in her blood,
  if she is given a small sniff after the loop climb (at the mile mark), Hannah has the
  most devastating kick in the state, and you can not count out this girl until the
  finish line.
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
  Leni Knowles
</h3>

<p>
  Primarily a state league basketballer, Leni has turned heads this season for a few
  reasons! One, her fluent running form is a standout, and two, her recent silver medal
  in the U15 girls national All Schools 800m (2.11). Yes, another SA girl in that talented
  U15 age group. However, Leni brings absolute speed to this field (58s quarter miler) and
  ever-improving endurance. It would not be a surprise if she’s 20-30 seconds quicker
  this year than last year (7th in 7:33 in 2025).
</p>

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
  Brooke Hines
</h3>

<p>
  Dietician by trade, but distance runner by blood! Brooke spent time in the NCAA system
  and is now back, mixing working life with her running! This season has seen some form
  return to her. With lifetime PBs of 4:30 for 1500m and 9:40 for 3000m, Brooke will feel
  at home here on the Uni loop! 29 is far from old, but the Saint’s President brings
  probably the most racing experience to this field, and she’ll be aiming to push some
  young ladies off the podium!
</p>

<p>
  These talented girls will be joined by fellow star SA distance athletes: Gracie
  Sheridan, Eva Flint, India Goodall, Elise Dandie, Lauren Ward, Eden Grant, Maeya
  Robinson, Sofia Heyward, Hayley Redman, Pia Marschall &amp; Violette Smith.
